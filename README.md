 TomSz’s Bike Shop Power BI Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

Project Overview  
TomSz’s Bike Shop is experiencing inconsistent sales across time periods and lacks a clear understanding of its customer base. This dashboard project aims to answer:

How can TomSz’s Bike Shop improve staffing, customer targeting, and seasonal performance based on historical sales and rider data?

The objective is to generate actionable insights to support better scheduling, marketing efforts, and customer engagement strategies.

 Key Business Questions  
- When should the shop increase staffing and stock to meet peak demand?
- How do seasonal changes affect sales performance?
- Is the business overly reliant on one customer type, limiting growth?

 Dashboard Features  
- Hourly Sales Table. Identifies peak hours by showing revenue and rider volume by time of day  
- Monthly Trend Line Chart. Reveals long-term trends in revenue and rider activity  
- Seasonal Revenue Bar Chart. Highlights performance shifts across seasons  
- Rider Demographic Donut Chart. Displays customer type distribution  

Key Insights  
- Peak sales occur midday and early evening, suggesting ideal times to boost staffing and inventory  
- Sales drop significantly during Season 1 (likely winter), while Season 3 (summer) performs best  
- Over 81% of customers belong to a single rider group, revealing a limited customer mix  


Business Recommendations  
1. Optimise Staffing During Peak Hours
   → Increase staff and stock availability from 12 PM to 8 PM  

2. Launch Seasonal Promotions in Low-Performing Periods
   → Offer winter-specific campaigns and discounts to stabilize revenue  

3. Diversify Customer Segments
   → Use targeted marketing to reach underrepresented rider types (e.g. families, students)
